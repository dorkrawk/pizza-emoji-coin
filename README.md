## What Is 🍕coin?

🍕coin is a simple, complete cryptocurrency including:
- a wallet
- a blockchain

🍕coin is written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) and based very heavily on [this awesome blog post](https://cranklin.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/lets-create-our-own-cryptocurrency/).

If you're talking about 🍕coin, it is pronounced: "pizza emoji coin".

## Why?

I've been goofing around in the [Dogecoin community](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) lately and it's been fun. I've been looking for a project to work on using Crystal and this seemed like it would be fun, too.

I enjoy fun things. They're fun.
